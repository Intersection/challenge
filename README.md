# Coding Challenge - Child Rummy

Child Rummy is a simple variation of rummy, where each player is dealt 7 cards,
and a player wins by being the first to have a 3-of-a-kind and a 4-card-run in
their hand. After dealing, the remaining cards are stacked face-down (called
the stack), and the top card on the stack is turned face-up next to the stack,
(beginning the discard pile). Play is strictly round robin, and each player's
turn consists of picking a card from either the top of the stack or the top
of the discard pile, adding the card to their hand, and then discarding to the
top of the discard pile. A player can only declare they win during their turn.

Pick **at least two** of the challenges below (you can do more!). You can
decide to keep them separate, or integrated (eg. user-interface with card-game
mechanics). Be creative!

## 1: Game Mechanics

Implement Child Rummy with a very-simple (text-based) user-interface in
whatever programming language you'd like. At least one player should be a human
player, and the rest can be very simple bots (take a random card, discard a
random card).

## 2: Goal Detection

Given a player's hand, implement an algorithm to detect if a hand is a winning
hand or not.

## 3: User Interface

Implement a user-interface for Child Rummy, including the actions which
manipulate the user-interface, like dealing, picking a card, discarding,
and winning.

## 4: Smart Bots

Implement the logic for a bot which attempts to win the game.
